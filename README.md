These are the lessons taught during the [FCC Starterkit][starterkit] (the format is heavily inspired by the LHCb starterkit!).
If you'd like to join the next workshop, visit [the website][starterkit] to find out when that will how and how to sign up.

If you'd just like to learn about how to use the FCC software, [read on](first-analysis-steps-renamed/README)!
